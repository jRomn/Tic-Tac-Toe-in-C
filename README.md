# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-C
This C++ program implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, serving as a practical exercise to explore fundamental programming concepts.  

**Logical Operators:** Employed for combined conditions (e.g., !is_winner() && !is_filled()).

**Conditional Statements:** Determine if board is filled, if there's a winner, and player turns (e.g., if, else if).

**Loops:** Used for iterating over the board and handling player turns until there is a winner or board has been filled out (e.g., while).

**Arrays:** Represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board as a 3x3 grid character array (e.g., char board[9]).

**Functions:** Break down the game logic into modular, reusable functions (e.g., Set_Position(), Update_Board(), draw()).

**Modular Programming:** Promotes code organization and reusability by dividing the game into well-defined functions.

This project aligns with Codecademy's curriculum, providing a hands-on exercise to solidify your grasp of these fundamental C++ concepts.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., MSVC, GCC, Clang).
3. Compile the code using a command like cl tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe (replace tic_tac_toe.cpp with your actual filename). 
4. Run the compiled executable (./tic_tac_toe) to start playing!
